AI projects for learning concepts

This respository contains the mini-projects for understanding the concepts of Artificial Intelligence. The projects are chosen from the course 'CS50â€™s Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence with Python' which can be found here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/#knowledge .

The project 'AI-for-tictactoe'  contains the implementation of minimax algorithm for tic-tac-toe. The complete description of the problem can be found here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/0/tictactoe/ .

The project 'AI/_for/_minesweeper' contains the implementation of an AI for Minesweeper which uses the concept of knowledge and logic. The description of the problem can be found here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/1/minesweeper/ .

It'd be great if someone can give suggestions on improving the techniques.
