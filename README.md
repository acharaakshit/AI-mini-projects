# AI-mini-projects
AI projects for learning concepts

This respository contains the mini-projects for understanding the concepts of Artificial Intelligence. The projects are chosen from the course 'CS50â€™s Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence with Python' which can be found here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/#knowledge .

'tictactoe'  contains the implementation of minimax algorithm for tic-tac-toe. The complete description of the problem can be found here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/0/tictactoe/.

'minesweeper' contains the implementation of an AI for Minesweeper which uses the concept of knowledge and logic. The description of the problem can be found here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/1/minesweeper/.

'heredity' uses the concept of Uncertainty (joint probability in specific). The desciption of the problem can be found here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/2/heredity/. To run the script use: python heredity.py data/family0.csv (any of the csv files in the data folder can be used as an argument). 

'crossword' uses constraint programming to generate a crossword puzzle. The problem description can be found here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/3/crossword/. To run the script use python generate.py data/structure1.txt data/words1.txt output.png where the first agrument is a structure, second argument is the words file and third is for generating the output.png file for the puzzle.  

'nim' contains the implementation of nim game using Q-Learning. The problem description is here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/4/nim/.

'traffic' uses convolutional neural networks to identify traffic signs. The problem description is here https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/5/traffic/ . The dataset can be downloaded from here https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/spring/projects/5/gtsrb.zip. To run the script use python traffic.py /full/path/to/dataset/.

It'd be great if someone can give suggestions on improving the techniques.
